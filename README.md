# simple_communication_between_friends
This is a simple concurrent application which creates a process for each person in the calls.txt file. Each process always listen for any messages from other 
processes and also can send messages to other processes. Whenever a process gets a message it will send a response message back to the sender process. For 
more details check the project.pdf file.

The importance of this project is to understand how concurrency one of the design principle of Erlang, is supported by my very simple message passing mechanism 
by the Erlang. This project helped me to understand the importance of choosing right programming language depending up on the problem we need to solve.
